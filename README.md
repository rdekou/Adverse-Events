# Adverse-Events



This repository contains two IPython Notebooks with sample code.



The first notebook 'Adverse_event_drug_prep.ipynb' retrieves the names of the drugs associated with each adverse event, stores them as a transactional datbase (drug_event_clean.csv). Then it investigates the adverse events differences by countries.

The second notebook 'association_rules.ipynb' processes the transactional database generated by the first one and  finds association rules of the drugs.


### Data Description

The FDA&#39;s database of adverse event reports is made available through a web API at

https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/. Each report contains general information about the report,

patient information, a list of the drugs that the patient is taking, and a list of the patient reactions.  It

is possible to use these data in many ways: your brief is to explore these data and to see what might

be learned from them. 


### Task

As a guide, for the present work I have investigated the following questions: 

 
        What drugs tend to be taken together?
        
        Are different adverse events reported in different countries? 
        
        
I have used 10 files from 2015 reports  (2015 Q4 (part 1 till part 10))
